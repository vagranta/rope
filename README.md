# A Quick Introduction

**Rope**, is a learning tool for helping you start the wonderful programming paradigm known as functional programming. It is essentially like the popular coding introduction platform 'Scratch', except for more experienced imperative programmers. It is a small functional programming language, called 'Rope' which provides a very nice and easy to learn syntax that will help you dive into functional programming in a very easy and interactive way.

However, this is not a website. It is a learning tool in which you will have to download, install, and learn; hopefully from the documentation that was given. Rope is free software, as it is licensed under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology public license. You can see more at the Open Source Initiative link: <https://opensource.org/license/mit>
